# Get Symbols

We start off by loading `basic_symbols()` into the `symbols` variable:

```{r get-symbols-symbols}
print(basic_symbols())

symbols <- basic_symbols()
```

`getSymbols()` is part of the `quantmod` package which was automatically loaded when we loaded `quantstrat`. It should have been installed automatically when you install `quantstrat`. 

We send a request through `getSymbols()` to download data. We can use any of the following sources:

** Yahoo!

** Google

** MySQL

** RData

** CSV

For data other than stocks we can use:

** [FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) source](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/);  FRED contains data such as unemployment, GDP, treasury rates and more. 

** [OANDA](https://www.oanda.com/) is a subscription-service for forex and currency data. 
## Yahoo!

```{r get-symbols-yahoo-getsymbols}
getSymbols(Symbols = symbols, 
           src = "yahoo", 
           index.class = "POSIXct",
           from = start_date, 
           to = end_date, 
           adjust = adjustment)
```

The first thing you notice is the warning message. As it states, it will only appear the first time you run `getSymbols()` in a new session.

```{r get-symbols-comment-1, include = FALSE}
#' What is this message stating exactly and how will the next version of 
#'      quantmod affect our code?
```

** **Symbols**: one or a vector of multiple symbols. 

** **src**: string, our source. In this case, Yahoo!

** **index.class**: POSIXct. This sets the class of our xts object index. 

** **from**: string, first date of data we want to retrieve

** **end**: string, last date of data we want to retrieve

** **adjust**: boolean, whether to adjust our data or not. Suggested to set as TRUE.

`getSymbols` will load xts objects for each of the symbols we passed into our Global Environment. We can view the data as we would any other dataset.

```{r get-symbols-remove-yahoo-symbols}
head(IWM)
tail(IWM)
summary(IWM)
# Clear symbols
rm(list=basic_symbols())
```

## Google

```{r get-symbols-google-getsymbols}
getSymbols(Symbols = symbols, 
           src = "google", 
           index.class = "POSIXct",
           from = start_date, 
           to = end_date, 
           adjust = adjustment)
```

We access data from Google same as Yahoo! only changing the **src** parameter. 

```{r get-symbols-remove-google-symbols}
head(IWM)
tail(IWM)
summary(IWM)
# Clear symbols
rm(list=basic_symbols())
```

## MySQL

```{r get-symbols-hidden-1, include = FALSE}
source("../.my.conf.R")
```

```{r get-symbols-mysql-getsymbols}
getSymbols(Symbols = symbols, 
           src = "MySQL", 
           dbname = db, 
           user = user, 
           password = pw, 
           host = host,
           index.class = "POSIXct",
           from = start_date, 
           to = end_date, 
           adjust = adjustment)
```

To load data via MySQL database we need to supply additional parameters: **dbname**, **user**, **password** and **host**. **user** needs to have SELECT privileges but nothing more for our purposes.

`getSymbols()` does not currently permit passing database values via a my.cnf file. The parameters are checked early in the function so either you need to include them in the call or include them in a hidden R file outside of your project directory and source the file.

Your database should contain a table named by symbol, one for each symbol. Each table should have the following fields: **date**, **o**, **h**, **l**, **c**, **v** and **a**. If your table has different field names you must add them to the *db.fields* parameter as a character vector. 

You can also change the names of the fields as they are imported into R by using the *field.names* parameter. However, none of that is required as long as *db.fields* meets the default criteria. 

The data in my database is a duplicate of Yahoo!. The output below is to show the success of the `getSymbols(src="MySQL")` call.

```{r get-symbols-remove-mysql-symbols}
head(IWM)
tail(IWM)
summary(IWM)
# Clear symbols
rm(list=basic_symbols())
```

## FRED

For this example we'll bail on the `symbols` we have been using prior. FRED contains over 11,000 econonomic datasets at no cost. 

Let's look at the 10-Year Treasury Rate:

> https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DGS10

Notice the tail of the url has the alphanumeric string **DGS10** which we will be using in our `getSymbols()` call. 

```{r get-symbols-fred-getsymbols}
getSymbols(Symbols = "DGS10", src = "FRED")
```

Notice our call is shorter than previous; we do not need to classify index nor do we need to adjust any data. 

In addition, passing data parameters doesn't seem to do anything; the entire dataset is returned. 

I'll use `quantmod::chartSeries()` to plot the data:

```{r get-symbols-dgs10-chartseries}
chartSeries(DGS10)
```

```{r get-symbols-remove-DGS10}
rm(DGS10)
```

## OANDA

Oanda only allows up to 6 months of data downloading.
If you are looking for foreign exchange currency data, downloading the data from your preferred currency is advisable and easy through the MT4 platform which you can download for free "https://www.metatrader4.com/". This method allows you to look at all possible exchange rates (as far as I know).
Once you have opened your currency chart, simply choose the timeframe and scroll back as far as you please.
Then go to Tools<Data Center (or F2), and you will be able to download the data you just generated in the platform.

A bit of wrangling will get your data set to the xts format getSymbols produces
```{r sample code FX data}
EUtx <- read.csv("C:/Users/Jhon doe/Documents/R/FXdata/EURUSD.csv", header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
colnames(EUtx) <- c("Date","Open","High","Low","Close","Volume")
EUtx$Date <- as.Date(EU240tx$Date, format = "%Y.%m.%d %H:%M") 
EUtx <- xts(x = EUtx[,2:6], order.by = EUtx[,1])
plot(Cl(EUtx))  #this plot assumes quantstrat is already loaded
```
